# ðŸ§  Complete List of Data Structures for DSA

This guide covers all major data structures used in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), with brief descriptions and use-cases. Great for interviews, competitive programming, and system design foundations.

## ðŸ”¹ Linear Data Structures

| Data Structure | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Array** | Fixed-size or resizable collection of elements. Fast index access. |
| **Linked List** | Nodes connected via pointers. Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular. |
| **Stack** | LIFO (Last In First Out). Use: Undo, expression evaluation. |
| **Queue** | FIFO (First In First Out). Use: Scheduling, buffers. |
| **Deque** | Double-Ended Queue â€” insert/remove at both ends. |
| **String** | Sequence of characters; supports special algorithms like KMP, Z-algo. |

## ðŸ”¹ Hash-Based / Key-Value Structures

| Data Structure | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **HashMap / Hash Table** | Key-value pairs with average O(1) access. |
| **HashSet** | Unique unordered values; fast lookup. |

> ðŸ“Œ Examples:
> - Python: `dict`, `set`  
> - Java: `HashMap`, `HashSet`  
> - C++: `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`

## ðŸ”¹ Tree-Based Structures

| Data Structure | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Binary Tree** | Each node has up to 2 children. |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Left < Root < Right for sorted structure. |
| **AVL Tree** | Self-balancing BST (height-balanced). |
| **Red-Black Tree** | Balanced BST used in many libraries (like TreeMap). |
| **Heap (Min/Max)** | Complete binary tree for priority queues. |
| **Segment Tree** | Range query + update (sum, min, max) in log time. |
| **Fenwick Tree (BIT)** | Efficient prefix sums with log time updates. |
| **Trie** | Prefix tree, used for string searching/autocomplete. |
| **N-ary Tree** | Node has multiple children (not just 2). |

## ðŸ”¹ Graph-Based Structures

| Graph Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Adjacency List / Matrix** | Common graph representations. |
| **Directed Graph** | Edges have direction. |
| **Undirected Graph** | Edges are bidirectional. |
| **Weighted Graph** | Edges have weights (used in Dijkstra, Kruskal). |
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | No cycles. Used in task scheduling, topological sort. |
| **Tree** | A connected acyclic graph (special case of a graph). |

## ðŸ”¹ Special / Advanced Structures

| Data Structure | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Priority Queue** | Elements with priority. Built using Heaps. |
| **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)** | Tracks connected components. Used in Kruskalâ€™s MST. |
| **Matrix** | 2D structure. Used in DP, games, simulations. |
| **Skip List** | Layered linked list for fast search (used in Redis). |
| **Bloom Filter** | Probabilistic set for fast approximate membership tests. |
| **LRU Cache** | Combines HashMap + Doubly Linked List for caching. |
